**SeedGenomics** is an intelligent, web-based classification system designed to distinguish between pumpkin seed varieties (*Çerçevelik* and *Ürgüp Sivrisi*) with high precision. 

Moving beyond traditional manual inspection, this project leverages machine learning to analyze quantitative morphological features—such as Area, Perimeter, and Aspect Ratio—processing them through a custom **Inference Engine** to provide instant taxonomic classification.

```

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup
### 1. Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python installed. You will also need the following libraries:

```Bash
pip install flask scikit-learn pandas numpy openpyxl
```

### 2. Train the Model
Before running the app, you must generate the trained model file.

Open model_building.ipynb in VS Code or Jupyter.

Run all cells to process the dataset and train the Random Forest.

Verify that model.pkl and scaler.pkl have appeared in your project folder.

### 3. Run the Application
Open your terminal in the project folder and run:

```Bash
python app.py
```

### 4. Access the Interface
Open your web browser and navigate to the local server address shown in the terminal (usually):
http://127.0.0.1:5000/

## 🧠 How It Works
Data Input: The user enters geometric values (e.g., Area: 56276, Perimeter: 888.24) into the web form.

Preprocessing: The backend loads the saved MinMaxScaler (scaler.pkl) to normalize the inputs to the same scale used during training.

Inference: The data is passed to the Random Forest model (model.pkl), which predicts the class (0 for Çerçevelik, 1 for Ürgüp Sivrisi).

Visualization: The frontend triggers a "Processing Geometry" animation state while the server computes the result.

Result: The final classification is displayed on a clean result card with a confidence summary.

## 🔮 Future Scope
Computer Vision Integration: Implementing CNNs to allow users to upload images of seeds for automatic feature extraction.

Mobile Application: Developing a React Native version for on-field usage by farmers.

IoT Connectivity: Linking the software with automated sorting machinery for industrial applications.
